# Manual installation ðŸ”Œ

To install Land SE manually you first have to install python on your compunter and install the following packages :

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run the main.py file content.

When the GUI show up, press on attach and go to your virtual machine to execute this : ( Will work on hydrogen etc.. )
```lua
getkey()

getgenv().key = "land0f0cdbf266e29d3adfae9da32279ee0492ff520340580fb6da99057085b92c5a"

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sponsoparnordvpn/VMInjector/main/init_executor.txt",true))()
```

You need to pass a 1 checkpoint linkvertise key system, and once it's done, put your key on getgenv().key.

The key passed, multiples warns / prints should appear : Congratulations, you did it !

Now enter your code in the code editor and press execute !!

Note : If it doesnt work try running it on a code IDE or just wait for Land LLC to release their c++ executor.
